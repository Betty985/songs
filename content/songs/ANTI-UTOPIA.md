Myself was taken since I was a young girl
Lost in the garden, wait for golden hour
Gazed by the others,fading like a flower
Got nothing to lose, then I see the real world
Be virtuous and delicate,your heroes will keep you safe
Love is pure love is cure,love is shield no one can break
Enjoy this wonderful place, stay away from the hustle
All the fairytales they told,build up a bloody castle
Now arm yourself and be brave,become your own rescuer
Clear your mind,put yourself first,have every changes captured
Break out of the glittering cage and save us against waves
It's time to born of fire

When the road ahead is full of black fog
When you are high and dry must walk alone
Oh,but I'll never give up
No turning back ,I will just want to gain my power
When the world forces me into the war
When the arrows fired from behind and come forth
Oh but I'll never give up
Seize by the territory this is what I pay for

Trace my life like a venture,write the aim at the first page
Be alive and grad my future, time for me to be awake
It's not my Utopia, asking for light from the god
The sword is on my own hands,treasure it don't let it rust
I burn out all those petals, no fears to face the battle
Who says girl cannot be a hero, who says girl must be fragile
Walk straightly into the smoke,then I can see the rainbow
Under nobody's control

When the road ahead is full of black fog
When you are high and dry must walk alone
Oh,but I'll never give up
No turning back,I will just want to gain my power
When arrows fried form behind and come forth
Oh,but I'll never give up
Seize back the territory this is what I pay for
Oh this is what I pay for
Oh what else should I fight for ?
